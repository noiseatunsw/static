It included a range of anti-protest measures, including providing 72 hour notice for certain actions, including usage of megaphones, amplifiers, projections, or banner drops, requiring that demonstrations be held in open places, and listing camping as an unacceptable activity.&#xA0;</p><p>The University of Sydney&apos;s changes to access policy received wide condemnation including from the NSW Council of Civil Liberties, and Amnesty Australia, and have seen students organise a major day of action against the policy, through their &#x201C;Unauthorised Stalls Day&#x201D;, with many clubs and societies signing on to collectively breach the new policies in protest.</p><p>However, with little to no consultation, UNSW quietlty passed their own &#x201C;Campus Policy&#x201D; months ago, which began to take effect on the 28th of May.</p><p>The new policy was added as a supplement to the formerly titled &#x201C;Student Code of Conduct&#x201D;, which itself was renamed to &#x201C;Code of Conduct and Values.&#x201D; Importantly, it no longer focuses on dictating policy for students, but wider visitors on campus. Similarly to the University of Sydney, UNSW has stated that the Inclosed Lands and Protection Act 1901 (NSW) applies to all University premises, providing a legal excuse for their increased scrutiny towards protestors.</p><p>The new provisions contain several measures which crackdown on rights to protest. New measures firstly require that &#x201C;unobstructed access is required at all times to and from campus building.&#x201D; Obstruction has long been used as a tactic by activists and protestors, employed throughout the sit-ins in the US, and South African Civil rights movements, as well as in opposition to the Vietnam War. When such policies are breached, the new provisions legitimise harsh use of force, stating that&#xA0; &#x201C;UNSW Security or NSW Police may remove any obstructions&#x201D;.&#xA0;</p><p>The policy provides that demonstrations cannot be conducted &#x201C;inside buildings.&#x201D; This severely limits the scale of protests that may be conducted by students. Furthermore, the policy requires protests to be &#x201C;orderly&#x201D; and &#x201C;peaceful&#x201D;, and that they &#x201C;do not disrupt, limit, or prevent others from going about their normal business&#x201D;. This drastically limits the ability for students to conduct effective and meaningful actions.&#xA0;</p><p>This essentially bans the use of student encampments, stating that &#x201C;sleeping or living arrangements on campus is not permitted at any time and is a breach of this policy. This includes sleeping in vehicles on campus, setting up beds or tents, the use of blankets, pillows or sleeping bags, moving furniture or other University property, or creating other living arrangements, temporary or permanent at any time of day.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>Encampments have been a historical vehicle used by students across the world, achieving strong success in fighting apartheid South Africa.</p><p>The policy requires that demonstrators act in accordance with the Anti-Racism and Anti-Religious Vilification Policy, which lists the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism in the &#x201C;supporting information regarding&#x2026; religious vilification&#x201D; tab. It has been widely criticised for conflating anti-zionism with anti-semitism, including by some of its authors. Although it is not included in the technical definition provided in the policy, there is uncertainty as to whether Pro-Palestine actions on campus will be allowed, or cracked down upon. Furthermore, the policy provides that demonstrators must provide the university with 48 hours notice before any demonstration, further inhibiting the ability for students to protest. Finally, the University authorises &#x2018;assistance from police&#x2019; when it &#x2018;reasonably believes&#x2019; UNSW staff cannot manage a &#x2018;potential incident.&#x2019; Given that the provisions neither define what reasonable means, nor what an incident is, this provides the University with very wide discretion to allow Police to interfere with student actions.</p><p>The new policies impede upon rights to free speech. It gives the University the right to remove any advertising and promotional material which breaches the Promotional and Advertising Guidelines for UNSW Campuses. Those guidelines were passed in November 2023, also with little attention.</p><p>Firstly, this includes any posters from groups unaffiliated with Arc or UNSW. Given that Arc has previously suspended club status to activist groups, and operates almost every other student organisation on campus, this tool provides powerful leverage to prevent postering from occurring.&#xA0;</p><p>Secondly, it only allows flyers &#x201C;associated with events and activities for affiliated clubs, societies, or organisations&#x201D; to be handed out. Given that activist demonstrations are rarely organised in student spaces, it essentially restricts student&#x2019;s ability to communicate wider protests and actions.&#xA0;</p><p>Students have already seen this crackdown occur in front of them. Students against War, an activist group on campus recently posted a video they filmed of a staff member taking down a photo in front of them, commenting that it was &#x201C;manifestly absurd&#x201D; for &#x201C;notice boards to exclusively communicate events held by organisations with formal links to UNSW&#x201D;. A spokesperson for SAW, upon reaching out, also said</p><blockquote>&#x201C;It is clear UNSW was targeting pro-Palestine materials in a desperate attempt to cover up its ties to Israel&apos;s genocide. UNSW has investments in multiple weapons manufacturing companies, including developing research for Lockheed Martin&#x2019;s Hypersonic control system for missiles, UNSW Engineering developing munitions for Boeing, and involving undergraduate students in the process of developing IP for Quickstep through their Hype X program, creating parts for F-35 fighter jets in Bankstown&#x2014;All companies that have armed Israel&#x2019;s genocide.&#x201D;</blockquote><p>Cherish Kuehlmann, a long term activist at UNSW, and current SRC Education Officer, said</p><blockquote>&#x201C;I&apos;ve postered for rallies and organised speakouts outside the main library for years regarding LGBTI+ rights, Indigenous rights, course cuts, housing justice and so on - with no issues from security. The adoption of these new regulations demonstrates UNSW is seeking to limit and police political expression on campus. Posters for many rallies such as Invasion Day protests are provided to students by community campaigns which often don&#x2019;t have a UNSW or Arc affiliation on it. For UNSW to daily enforce the removal of independent activist posters is an attack on this kind of independent activism.<br>UNSW has statues of Gandhi, Martin Luther King, and Nelson Mandela in front of the main library. These important figures led mass civil disobedience and protest movements against historic injustices that, by necessity, disrupted &#x2018;business as usual.&#x2019; Disrupting business as usual is the definition of an effective protest. The commemoration of people like MLK while restricting protest and free speech on campus is hypocritical. Students shouldn&apos;t need permission to hold a peaceful speakout in front of the library. We don&apos;t have the same power management or the government have, so how else are students and the marginalised meant to have their voices heard? That&#x2019;s why globally staff and students have an important history of activism on campuses. Protest and freedom of speech is an important part of any democracy.&#x201D;</blockquote><p>Gina Elias, the current convenor of UNSW Students for Palestine and the UNSW SRC&#x2019;s Environment Officer, was also broadly critical of the policy when we reached out for comment. She said that</p><blockquote>&#x201C;Students should not have to ask permission of the university to hold a rally or talk to other students; this is free speech! I think UNSW is trying to silence growing opposition to Israel&#x2019;s genocide, because universities are being held to account for their complicity. This makes the democratic right to protest and hold powerful institutions to account even more crucial to a healthy democracy. Students have held even more disruptive mass climate strikes before, without the same threats from the university. UNSW&#x2019;s restrictions indicate that they want to distract from rather than act on students&#x2019; demands for divestment. We refuse to be intimidated into silence! Fortunately, we know we have a lot of support from students, staff and the public. Hundreds have signed petitions demanding divestment and many more protested against this genocide.&#x201D;</blockquote>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hacker takes over Honi Soit Website]]></title><description><![CDATA[The editors of Honi Soit have been locked out of the website by an anonymous USYD student.]]></description><link>https://www.noiseatunsw.com/honi-soit-pda-dear-honi/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">66a8f66e25ab9500013a2512</guid><category><![CDATA[Honi Soit]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Pepsi]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2024 06:00:36 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://www.noiseatunsw.com/content/images/2024/07/Copy-of-Cover-Images-for-Web-7-.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.noiseatunsw.com/content/images/2024/07/Copy-of-Cover-Images-for-Web-7-.png" alt="Hacker takes over Honi Soit Website"><p>An unauthorised article has been published on the website of USYD student paper Honi Soit, with its author claiming to have found &#x201C;major vulnerabilities&#x201D; in Honi Soit&#x2019;s website. Titled &quot;PDA - Dear Honi&quot;, the 149 word message holds no clear malicious motives, beyond being a 3rd year Electrical Engineering and Comp Sci Student.</p><p>The post also makes reference to a &#x201C;cyber attack&#x201D; during the Sydney Computing Society&#x2019;s recent &#x201C;bot battle&#x201D; event. It is unknown if the same individual is responsible for that incident.The hacker, going by the name &quot;flopper&quot;, claims to have &quot;no malicious intentions&quot;, stating that the exploit was &quot;just something stumbled across&quot;. They also stated that &quot;it would be nice if Honi Soit cooperated, for their own sake&quot;.&#xA0;</p><p>Noise has confirmed that the attack was unrelated to the current &#x201C;Unauthorised Stalls Day&#x201D; being run today in protest of the <a href="https://www.noiseatunsw.com/usyd-policy-threatens-protests/"><u>controversial new Campus Access Policy</u></a>.</p><p>Initial attempts to remove the post were foiled by the author, who stated that they will keep re-uploading, and asked Honi not to test them.

The new version comes with a variety of changes to these requirements and rules, meaning all clubs will have to make changes to their constitutions and the way they run certain meetings and events to continue their affiliation.</p><p>One of the main changes are those to general meetings. Clubs must now send out notice fourteen days prior to the meeting, up from the previous seven days.</p><p>If an election is to be held at this meeting, the fourteen day notice will include the contact information of the new returning officer for nominees to send their nominations. Notably, election nominations will now close seven days prior to an election, whereas previously one could nominate themselves for a position mere minutes before the election in many clubs.</p><p>Another change to general meetings is the change to how quorum is met. All general meetings require a certain number of people in attendance before the meeting can start; 10 members or 50% of members, whichever is less, for clubs newer than 18 months or who have less than 75 members, or 15 members for all other clubs. It is worth noting that this is the minimum requirement, and clubs may set out a higher quorum in their constitution should they desire. Previously, club executives have counted towards the number of members in attendance, however, the new policy restricts quorum to only members who did not hold executive positions in the past year.</p><p>Another change affecting elections is the new mandatory role of the returning officer. Returning officers run elections and help ensure election integrity. These officers will be appointed by the outgoing executive at least fourteen days before the election and must be determined to be impartial with no real or perceived bias or conflicts of interest. They do not have to be former executive officers.</p><p>The new policy also brings a new mandatory role, the Welfare Officer. The Welfare Officer combines the former roles of Grievance officer and EDI officer, and their responsibilities include fostering an inclusive culture within the club, ensure events do not lead to &#x201C;poor wellbeing outcomes&#x201D;, and to receive and act upon any grievances around the club.</p><p>While the addition of the Welfare Officer role has garnered the largest amount of attention, there are two additional changes to the executive structure which are notably absent from the webpage of the listed changes.</p><p>The first one of these is that the roles of Secretary and Arc Delegate have now been merged, all of which are now responsibilities of the Secretary. It is not uncommon for clubs to have one person administering both roles, or even already formally mandating the change in their own constitution.&#xA0;The name <em>SArcretary </em>was offered to them, but was not acted upon.</p><p>The other major change is the addition of a recommended Vice-President role. The draft constitution sets out the roles of the Vice-President to mainly assist and take secondary responsibilities to ensure the smooth running and operation of the club, and its executive. While the role itself is not required, the responsibilities of the Vice-President role are required to exist in the executive, whether through a Vice-President or other executive roles.</p><p>A minor addition that all clubs will have to make to their club constitutions is the introduction of a not-for-profit clause. In 2021 the federal government made changes around the self-assessment for income tax exemption for not-for-profit entities, this change in clubs constitution is in line with these new federal changes.</p><p>Another big change is the introduction of a Clubs Tribunal, a panel that grievance appeals can be raised to if an individual feels that they were unfairly punished for a grievance by a club. Five students will form this panel and will be randomly selected from a pool of former grievance and welfare officers who have nominated themselves for membership. When an appeal is raised, the tribunal may conduct additional investigations and will review the evidence that led to the original decision in order to determine if they will uphold the original decision, dismiss the original decision, change the penalty of the original decision, order the club to do a new investigation, refer misconduct to UNSW Conduct and Integrity or report an incident to the police if there is evidence of a crime. The tribunal will make decisions by majority vote and all decisions will be final.</p><p>In addition to many mandatory changes, Arc Clubs have also included some recommended changes, which include the ability for the executive team to remove absent executives without needing to hold an EGM, allowing interim executives to be appointed, and having incoming executives start their roles at the end of t</p><p>Clubs will have to make these changes before they apply for reaffiliation during term 3. The new requirements will not come into effect until after the AGM or EGM where the constitutional changes are passed.</p><p>You can view the new Arc Clubs Policy <a href="https://www.arc.unsw.edu.au/uploads/Arc%20Clubs%20Procedures%20V29%20July%202024.pdf?ref=noiseatunsw.com"><u>here</u></a> to review all the new changes.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[USYD Protest Policy Threatens Student Voices]]></title><description><![CDATA[Policies barring events with stalls, speakers, megaphones, posters, cooking equipment  without university approval have been condemned by students and human rights groups alike.]]></description><link>https://www.noiseatunsw.com/usyd-policy-threatens-protests/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">66a1c71d25ab9500013a24de</guid><category><![CDATA[University of Sydney]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alyss Cachia]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 06:00:29 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://www.noiseatunsw.com/content/images/2024/07/USyd-Policy-threatens-Protests---Cover-1.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.noiseatunsw.com/content/images/2024/07/USyd-Policy-threatens-Protests---Cover-1.png" alt="USYD Protest Policy Threatens Student Voices"><p>The&#xA0; University of Sydney&#x2019;s decision to implement a new <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/policies/showdoc.aspx?recnum=PDOC2011%2F143&amp;RendNum=0&amp;ref=noiseatunsw.com"><u>Campus Access Policy 2024</u></a> has been met with outrage by students and activist groups globally. Its key features ban camping activities, require university approval for common forms of protest and require notice for any demonstration. <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2024/04/24/statement-regarding-peaceful-protests-on-campus.html?ref=noiseatunsw.com"><u>Vice-chancellor Mark Scott claims</u></a> that &#x201C;[USyd] repeatedly stated that we support the right to peaceful protest&#x201D;, while swiftly changing pace stating &#x201C;<strong>provided</strong> it doesn&#x2019;t cause significant disruption to core university operations.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>This theme runs through the policy with approval required for activities using megaphones, speakers, attaching banners/posters, projectors, cooking equipment and temporary structures such as stalls. Approval for such activities must occur 72 hours (3 days) prior to the event. Students may recognise these materials from any protest or society event they&#x2019;ve ever seen, adding another layer of control and bureaucracy to student life and advocacy. Additionally, there is currently no criteria within the policy for activity approval or rejection, seemingly USyd is functioning off whatever they feel is correct. There even seems to be confusion as to what activities require approval, with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9yL9oYAXpZ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D"><u>campus security demanding approval for&#xA0; Students Against War handing out flyers</u></a> despite this not being in the policy.</p><p>The policy goes on to ban &#x201C;unacceptable&#x201D; activities under it, such as camping, seemingly a direct response to the Gaza encampment, despite the aforementioned &#x201C;support&#x201D; to the right to peaceful protest.&#xA0;</p><p>This is particularly disheartening after the Sydney University Muslim Students Association (SUMSA) and other groups successfully closed the encampment. The encampment secured <a href="https://honisoit.com/2024/07/newly-released-documents-reveal-universitys-ties-to-israel/?ref=noiseatunsw.com"><u>investment disclosure</u></a>, review of its divestment policy, additional funding to its scholars at risk program (with a focus on Gazan scholars), continued commitment to anti-racism, truth telling and establishment of an &#x2018;Experience Palestine&#x2019; unit in collaboration with Palestinian Universities.</p><p>UNSW itself similarly bans&#xA0; camping in its <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/content/dam/pdfs/governance/policy/2022-01-policies/campuspolicy.pdf?ref=noiseatunsw.com"><u>Campus Policy</u></a> as well as requiring 48 hours of notice before any demonstration. However, there is <strong>no</strong> requirement for university approval as in USyd&#x2019;s new policy.&#xA0; It is important to make sure UNSW shows solidarity with the fight at Usyd to ensure similar policies do not pass here.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>In response to this, the USyd SRC, Student activist groups and unions have mobilised against the policy, announcing an &#x201C;Unauthorised Stall Day&#x201D; on 12 pm July 31st as an act of mass disobedience to this policy. We&#x2019;ll continue to watch these developments as it&#x2019;s clear this policy sets a worrying precedent for Student Activism.&#xA0;</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Make Some Noise Episode 6 - The Welfare Special]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Noise team is joined by SRC Welfare Officer Annikka Burge, who's brought in a slew of initiatives around improving the student experience both on and off campus.

It is the most recent development for the bill which has hung in parliamentary limbo for more than a year, jumping from debate to consultation periods. Its key promises are a result of close consultation with the LGBTQ community and presented by Member for Sydney independent, Alex Greenwich.</p><p>It first allows trans people to amend gender markers on their birth certificate without needing costly and hard to access surgery.&#xA0; It then seeks to remove barriers for trans youth accessing gender-affirming healthcare in line with <a href="https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/100859?ref=noiseatunsw.com"><u>medical professionals&#x2019; advice</u></a>. Additionally, it proposes protection for LGBTQ+ communities from discrimination in the workplace and greater legislative recognition of LGBTQ+ families. The bill would complete the de-criminalisation of sex work providing the field with anti-discrimination and anti-vilification protections. These reforms bring NSW inline with other state jurisdictions.&#xA0;</p><p>The Minns Labor government of NSW have not supported the bill in full, instead separately passing a less controversial ban on harmful conversion therapy practices, which were originally contained in the Equality Bill. This lack of support is a result of pressure from right-wing anti-trans rhetoric, and religious groups which believe the rights given in this bill pose a threat to their religious freedoms and give legitimacy to &#x2018;gender ideology&#x2019;.&#xA0; A particular point of opposition is allowing self-ID of gender markers on birth certificates, a reform that is already implemented in South Australia, ACT and on federal documents without any issues arising.&#xA0; LGBTQ+ organisations have organised to support this bill from the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, ACON and Trans Justice Project (TJP).&#xA0;</p><p>These groups have called on the LGBTQ+ community and allies to contact or meet with their state representatives to voice their support. TJP has additionally called for people to join them from the 29th of July to the 2nd of August in a &#x2018;phone jam&#x2019; constantly calling the office of Premier Chris Minns to voice support for the bill with a call happening every 10 minutes.</p><div class="kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center"><a href="https://transjustice.org.au/mobilise-for-equality/?ref=noiseatunsw.com" class="kg-btn kg-btn-accent">Join TJP&apos;s Phone Jam</a></div><p>The bill&apos;s promises are a ray of hope for the LGBTQ+ community in the continued advancement of LGBTQ+ rights.

The L3 line (between Circular Quay and Juniors Kingsford) will not run at all. The L1 will not run from Lilyfield to Dulwich Hill in addition to the L2 not running from Central Chalmers to Circular Quay. Replacement buses will be provided on the L2 and L3 lines as well as between Lilyfield and Dulwich Hill.</p><p>In addition to these delays, previously scheduled maintenance work will take place on the L2 and L3 lines from 9:00pm to 1:00am on Monday to Wednesday.</p><p>Unlike most public transport networks globally, Sydney&#x2019;s light rail is privately operated by the French conglomerate Transdev, with drivers and maintenance teams being employees of the company rather than the government. The Rail, Tram, and Bus Union, which represents the staff of most major public transport infrastructure in Australia, has been demanding a 23% pay rise for light rail staff over the last 4 years, citing frequent exhaustion and the rising cost of living in Sydney. Transdev, in turn, has offered an 18% pay rise, despite an revenue increase of 21% (to 9.33 billion euro) from 2022. Transdev was also involved in the strikes earlier this year, in response to reports that staff on the L4 Parramatta line would receive $5/hour less than their colleagues on the city light rail lines.</p><blockquote><em>&#x201C;Workers from all areas of Sydney are doing it tough and failing to recognise the financial pressures its workforce is not going to help solve the current impasse.&#x201D;</em> <br>- RTBU Tram and Bus Division Secretary David Babineua</blockquote><h3 id="how-can-i-get-to-uni">How can I get to uni?</h3><p>The L2 will be running at a reduced frequency between Central and Randwick.</p><p>Central Chalmers Street (Stand G) has a replacement bus to Alison Rd before Cowper St, which is approximately 10 minutes walk from the UNSW High Street light rail station. Alternatively, the substitute for Randwick (Belmore Rd at Avoca St) is a downhill walk to UNSW. These replacement services will run every 10-15 minutes.</p><p>For lower campus/L3, Central Chalmers Street (Stand G) has a replacement bus to the NIDA bus stand (also stopping at Moore Park bus stand). These will also run every 10-15 minutes.</p><p>Other public transport options include:</p><ul><li>The 392 from Redfern</li><li>The 396 from Town Hall</li><li>The 390X from Bondi Junction</li><li>The 370 from Green Square</li></ul><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">&#x1F4A1;</div><div class="kg-callout-text">For more information and to plan your

src="https://www.noiseatunsw.com/content/images/2024/07/Copy-of-Cover-Images-for-Web-1.png" alt="July 2024 SRC Wrapup"><p>If you&#x2019;ve been disappointed by the relative civility displayed by the SRC over the past few months, then you&#x2019;re in luck because this meeting&#xA0;was exactly the level of chaos I was warned about when taking the mantle of the SRC Correspondent. In true student politics fashion, this month&#x2019;s meeting&#xA0;featured disputes surrounding the policies and Charter of the Council, controversial motions positioned to overthrow the most foundational aspects of our voting process, arguments about Federal government decisions, and a whole lot of interrogating the morals of various office-bearers. So, strap in, because this was a wild ride.</p><p>Before apologies were even finished, the arguments started, centred around members of the SRC in particular &#x2013; Left Action&#x2019;s Holly Walsh, and Revive&#x2019;s Alexander Pye, though neither were in attendance for this month&#x2019;s meeting. It was, in fact, their absence that was the source of the first debate of the night, as it came to light that Walsh had been removed from the SRC for failing to attend three consecutive meetings without submitting apologies.&#xA0;A back-and-forth began, with Left Action&#x2019;s Gina Elias insisting that Walsh was not notified of her dismissal and that she had actually attended a previous meeting, which Pye had not.&#xA0;Pye quickly found himself on the chopping block alongside Walsh for his similar absences, but General Secretary Paige Sedgwick asserted that he had submitted apologies for his absence and therefore was in compliance with the Council&#x2019;s charter. This issue ultimately found little resolution in the meeting, and Elias expressed concern over the &#x201C;<em>highly suspect</em>&#x201D; dismissal &#x201C;<em>during a week where [Revive is] moving a contentious motion to move SRC elections to flex week that benefits [Paige].</em>&#x201D;</p><p>The meeting was back on track for about five minutes before it was utterly derailed once more, as&#xA0;issues were raised by Left Action&#x2019;s Cherish Kuehlmann about&#xA0;Paige&#x2019;s potential conflict of interest in counting the votes of the aforementioned &#x201C;<em>contentious motion</em>&#x201D;.&#xA0;This launched the room into its second debate of the night before the first motion had even been moved, with&#xA0;Kuehlmann and Elias demanding the votes be counted in real-time and published immediately and non-anonymously (which is not usual) to prevent Paige from &#x201C;<em>rigging</em>&#x201D; the vote in her party&#x2019;s favour. Sedgwick maintained throughout the discussion that there were no regulations for this in the SRC&#x2019;s Charter and that they &#x201C;<em>[are] not changing this because [Cherish is]upset about it</em>.&#x201D; President Michael Rahme&#x2019;s attempt at mediation, with his offer to count the votes instead of Sedgwick, was swiftly shot down by Elias&#x2019; assertion that &#x201C;<em>You&#x2019;re in the same faction, Michael!</em>&#x201D;</p><p>Even once it had been decided that the results of the vote would be published immediately after their counting,&#xA0;Left Action was not finished expressing their distrust of the voting process, though they had now moved onto a new issue: the voting rights of the two &#x2018;Students with Disabilities&#x2019; Co-Officers, Geoffrey Zhen and Timothy To, or, rather, To&#x2019;s lack of voting rights. Although the two Office Bearers shared the seat in practice, only Zhen was permitted to vote on motions, as he had run as the voting member. This posed a logistical challenge as not only were Zhen and To not similarly politically aligned and therefore held different opinions on the motion, but Zhen was not actually in attendance at the meeting. Zhen had provided a proxy for his vote, which was not To but to Sedgwick, effectively leaving To without any say on the SRC.&#xA0;Left Action was very vocal about their disagreement with the so-called &#x201C;<em>Paige [Sedgwick] dictatorship</em>&#x201D;, claiming that she had been trying to intimidate members into not talking to Left Action before the meeting, and Elias criticised &#x201C;<em>the discrimination towards the Disabilities Officer</em>&#x201D;.</p><p>Finally, the dust settled, and we were able to move on to the first actual motion of the evening &#x2013; though an ominous air still lingered in the room as we awaited the inevitable conflict the night had been building up to.&#xA0;President Rahme moved a matter for immediate decision, submitted to the SRC only a few hours before their meeting, to amend the&#xA0;SRC&#x2019;s Charter and the Safer Spaces Policy. This was done as an immediate response to concerns raised by victim-survivors in the last two weeks, intended to take pressure off of the individual Office Bearers responsible for the running of SRC&#x2019;s Safe Spaces by streamlining the process of the 30-day suspension for perpetrators of gendered violence and bullying. Indigenous Students&#x2019; Officer Brydie Zorz raised issues surrounding the Indigenous Collective&#x2019;s Nira Gili, which is not under Arc&#x2019;s exclusive control and, therefore, may not fall under the Safer Spaces Policy, stating she wants more time to research and consult with the community and Elders to ensure cultural appropriateness. Environment Officer Elias suggested the motion be delayed until next month&#x2019;s meeting due to its late notice, while Rahme stressed the immediacy of the response as an interim solution which could be amended at a later date. The motion eventually passed.</p><p>Motion two was intended to be a vote to commit the SRC to endorse letters establishing First Nations representation on the UNSW Council.&#xA0;However, Zorz delayed this motion until the next meeting and instead used this time to move a procedural for the flexi-week motion for 1.5 minutes of speaking time for each speaker for an indefinite amount of speakers, to ensure each side would have adequate time to respond to each other. This was, to the immense appreciation of those of us covering the meeting, dismissed, and replaced with the far more reasonable alternative of allowing both the for and against camps with a maximum of seven speakers, with 1.5 minutes each. Rahme was able to approve this without a vote.</p><p>Thankfully, we were awarded a short break in between debates, as&#xA0;the next motion promised a pay rise of 52% for the SRC&#x2019;s office bearers to reflect the disproportionately low remunerations awarded to members of the UNSW Student Council in comparison to other universities. Unsurprisingly, all SRC members expressed their support, and the motion passed with&#xA0;little debate or even conversation.&#xA0;</p><p>This was the calm before the storm that was the following matter. The divisive proposal that had hung like an omen over the entire meeting:&#xA0;Sedgwick&#x2019;s motion to move UNSW SRC&#x2019;s elections to Flexi-Week. Splitting the SRC precisely down the middle, this motion featured the longest debate of the night, members of the Council publicly crossing the floor, (<a href="https://www.noiseatunsw.com/flex-week-election-proposal-to-see-labor-aligned-student-reps-cross-the-floor/">read more about this here</a>)&#xA0;accusations of threats and rigging the votes, calls of injustice and discrimination against groups underrepresented in student accommodation, questions about the individual morals and political motivations of various members from both sides of the divide, and a surprise guest appearance from the USYD SRC&#x2019;s President Harrison Brennan (<a href="https://www.noiseatunsw.com/hung-vote-controversial-election-motion-rejected-after-surprise-appearance-from-harrison-brennan/" rel="noreferrer">read more about this</a>). The motion failed by the smallest margin possible, with 12 votes for, 12 against, and one abstention from President Rahme, whose vote would typically decide a hung vote such as this.&#xA0;</p><p>The surrounding debate is too immense to discuss in this coverage &#x2013; however, if your curiosity has been piqued by this motion which had the potential to change the entire landscape of the UNSW SRC,&#xA0;we highly recommend reading the articles linked.</p><p>In a complete 180&#xB0; shift in both intensity and subject matter,&#xA0;the next motion called for the SRC to recommend that Arc make a public statement supporting the government&#x2019;s changes to welfare support for students on placement. The necessity of paid placement to combat the ongoing cost of living crisis that significantly impacts students who are not otherwise able to earn a steady income was agreed upon by all members of the SRC, though some Councillors made a point to criticise the Labor government for not having raised student placement hourly rates to match the national minimum wage. A proposed amendment by Left Action to include such criticism failed, as did Rahme&#x2019;s second unsuccessful attempt at finding a middle ground between the SRC&#x2019;s two factions by changing the name of the motion. Despite this, the motion passed, though not without an excellent quote from Sedgwick before the conclusion of the polls: &#x201C;<em>No one&#x2019;s screaming and shouting, so I&#x2019;m gonna close it</em>.&#x201D;</p><p></p><p>Following this, the night truly began to wind down, as the SRC took a 10-minute break due to the unusually lengthy nature of the meeting until, in the beautifully, unfortunately, coincidental words of Rahme, &#x201C;<em>9:11 [PM] hits</em>&#x201D;. When they returned,&#xA0;the council discussed three more motions, which regarded statements members wished to be made concerning Federal government matters. A motion to denounce Opposition Leader Peter Dutton&#x2019;s plan for Nuclear energy did not pass. Similarly, a motion for the SRC to reject the &#x201C;<em>slanderous</em>&#x201D; comments made towards Greens MPs for their support of Pro-Palestine protests to defend the right of protest also did not pass. Notably, Australians do not actually hold a Constitutional right to protest, beyond the right to freedom of political expression. The final motion of the evening, however, which called for UNSW to take immediate action in combatting the cost of living crisis through the promotion of grants programs, new access to accommodation and food packages, and increased funding for mental health services, did pass.</p><p></p><p>After three gruelling hours, the meeting finally came to a close, with one final comment from Rahme that the meeting &#x201C;<em>certainly [had] a creative style</em>&#x201D;. Well, that&#x2019;s one way of putting it.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Beginner's Guide to the UNSW SRC]]></title><description><![CDATA[Alice explores the key aspects of UNSW's Student Representative Council.]]></description><link>https://www.noiseatunsw.com/src-beginners-guide/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">668f3ae035392f0001bb6abf</guid><category><![CDATA[Student Politics]]></category><category><![CDATA[UNSW SRC]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alice Thompson]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 02:00:30 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://www.noiseatunsw.com/content/images/2024/07/Copy-of-Cover-Images-for-Web-4-.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-yellow"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">&#x1F4A1;</div><div class="kg-callout-text">This information is accurate to the 2024 UNSW SRC.

Don&#x2019;t worry, you&#x2019;re not alone, because I felt overwhelmed writing it. Student politics can be daunting when you know nothing about it, but, luckily for you, I&#x2019;ve compiled this handy beginners guide to help you through the chaos that is UNSW SRC.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-src">What is the SRC?</h2><p>The SRC, or Student Representative Council, is composed of 27 elected members, all of whom are students at UNSW. This includes:</p><h3 id="the-president">The President</h3><p>Responsible for convening and chairing SRC meetings, the President acts as the official spokesperson for the Council, and the primary point of contact between the SRC and the various other Boards and Committees at UNSW.</p><h3 id="the-general-secretary">The General Secretary</h3><p>Head of clerical and administrative responsibilities, the General Secretary condenses relevant information for SRC use, identifies and facilitates the provision of resources to Council projects, coordinates a central calendar of events and functions, and takes minutes for, and counts votes in, SRC meetings.</p><h3 id="three-general-office-bearers-and-eight-collective-office-bearers">Three General Office Bearers and eight Collective Office Bearers</h3><p>Representing students at Council meetings, raising and discussing issues affecting students, and recommending proposals to the SRC, OBs chair and facilitate meetings of their respective Collectives, and assist with the general administration and organisation of all SRC events, including:</p><ul><li>The Education Officer, responsible for promoting access to and quality of education at UNSW.&#xA0;</li><li>The Welfare Officer, who supports the principle of universal student welfare through awareness and campaigning.</li><li>The Environment Officer, responsible for coordinating campaigns that improve the sustainability and environmentalism of ARC, the SRC, and UNSW.</li><li>The International Students&#x2019; Officer, who acts to ensure international students&#x2019; issues are adequately represented on Council.</li><li>The Indigenous Officer, who acts as a spokesperson on Indigenous issues, and ensure the issues affecting Indigenous students are adequately represented in the SRC.</li><li>The Queer Officers, who act as spokespeople for Queer students, creating awareness and visibility on campus to ensure that Queer issues are adequately represented on Council. This seat can be split between two members.</li><li>The Students with Disabilities Officers, spokespeople who advocate for support for students with disabilities, in particular, maintaining accessibility to coursework, welfare, physical access, and general accessibility at UNSW. This seat can be split between two members.</li><li>The Women&#x2019;s Officer, who works to support women in higher education at UNSW and ensures feminism and women&#x2019;s issues are adequately represented in the SRC.</li><li>The Ethno-Cultural Officer, who acts as a spokesperson for students from diverse ethnic, linguistic and cultural backgrounds, including POC, ensuring the Council recognises the diversity of experiences of people from ethnically diverse backgrounds, and advocating for a university which is tolerant, respectful, and free of racism.</li></ul><h3 id="three-paddington-campus-office-bearers">Three Paddington Campus Office Bearers</h3><p>The Paddington Representation Officer, Paddington Domestic Officer, and Paddington International Officer act as the major points of contact between Paddington students and the various Boards and Committees at UNSW, coordinating events and initiatives, and ensuring a strong and equitable voice in the SRC for Paddington students.</p><h3 id="twelve-councillors-with-six-from-each-electorate">Twelve Councillors, with six from each Electorate</h3><p>Representing students at Council meetings, raising and discussing issues affecting students, and promoting the activities and campaigns of the SRC to students. At least four of these Councillors, two from each electorate, must be women or gender diverse. Electorate A includes the Arts, Design &amp; Architecture, Law, and Business Schools at UNSW, while Electorate B includes the Engineering, Medicine, and Sciences Schools.&#xA0;</p><h2 id="what-do-they-do">What do they do?</h2><p>They work to advocate for the rights of students, engaging in campus-wide campaigns to address the issues that affect us. They also run the Student Collectives, which provide additional support services to different underrepresented groups at UNSW, and organise various different events and initiatives.</p><h3 id="how-are-they-elected">How are they elected?</h3><p>Elections are run every year in Term Three, and all Undergraduate Students are eligible to vote in the online polls, although some restrictions apply depending on the positions of Office Bearers, as defined by ARC Regulations.</p><p>The positions of International, Indigenous, Students with Disabilities, and Ethno-Cultural Officers may only be run for, and voted by, students who ARC recognises as members of these groups.</p><p>The Queer Collective maintains an independent election, meaning only members of the Collective may run or vote for the positions of the Queer Officers.</p><p>Only students whose main program is undertaken at the UNSW Art &amp; Design campus may run or vote for the positions of the Paddington Representation Officer, Paddington Domestic Officer, and Paddington International Officer.</p><h3 id="who-runs-for-office">Who runs for office?</h3><p>UNSW currently has two major political parties, known as &#x201C;tickets&#x201D;, who pool their resources to produce campaign materials during elections.</p><h4 id="reviveunity">Revive/Unity</h4><p>Revive (formerly Together) is the UNSW ticket which semi-affiliates with the Labor party on both a State and Federal level. &#x201C;Student Unity&#x201D; is the national equivalent of this ticket, and is the most consistently used name.</p><p>Their 2024 campaign pushed for paid work placements, a stronger voice for Indigenous students, more funding for the UNSW Mental Health Clinic, and a cap on maximum assessment weighting. In the last two years, they have introduced free menstrual products to bathrooms across UNSW, and created the Food Bank for students to access free and heavily discounted food in times of crisis.</p><p>They have been criticised in previous years for an unwillingness to criticize government policies, strong ties to the Labor party, frequent name changes, and a lack of transparency from members in governance positions.</p><p>Notable members of the 2024 SRC who ran with the Revive ticket include President Michael Rahme, General Secretary Paige Sedgwick, Welfare Officer Annikka Burge, Women&#x2019;s Officer Imandi Mudugamuwa, Indigenous Officer Brydie Zorz, International Student&#x2019;s Officer Alexander Pye, and Students with Disabilities Co-Officer Geoffrey Zhen.&#xA0;</p><h4 id="left-action">Left Action</h4><p>Left Action is the ticket affiliated with the Socialist Alternative, which has no political backing in NSW or in the Federal government.&#xA0;</p><p>In their 2024 campaign, they pushed for increased Centrelink support for students, paid education, a $100 per week cap on rentals, and action on the Cost of Living crisis. Left Action actively discourages engaging with UNSW governance on issues, preferring to protest actions they disagree with. Most protest actions at UNSW, including events by Students For Palestine, are led by this group.</p><p>They have been criticised in previous years for harassing students during elections, an unwillingness to address pertinent issues at the university, and &#x201C;unrealistic&#x201D; expectations.</p><p>Notable members of the 2024 SRC who ran with the Left Action ticket include Education Officer Cherish Kuehlmann, and Environment Officer Gina Elias, along with a number of councillors.</p><h4 id="minor-parties-and-independents">Minor Parties and Independents</h4><p>Despite running on different parties&#x2019; tickets, there are Office Bearers and Councillors who align themselves with UNSW Labor Left, or NLS. Their political focus is on the fight for a humane refugee policy for Australia, women&#x2019;s rights, eliminating economic inequality, LGBTQIA+ rights, solidarity with First Nations peoples and the advent of socialism in Australia. Notable members of the 2024 SRC include Ethno-Cultural Officer Diya Sengupta and Councillor Elaine Pope.</p><p>The Queer Officers Pepsi Sharma and Rebecca Blundell ran as Independents, as a result of the internal election process of the Queer Collective. Paddington Representation Officer Danielle Moutopoulos, Paddington Domestic Officer Edward Zhong, and Paddington International Officer Nishita Kishore, are similarly Independant. Students with Disabilities Co-Officer Timothy To also identifies as an Independent, despite running on the Revive ticket.</p><h3 id="why-should-i-care-about-any-of-this">Why should I care about any of this?</h3><p>The SRC is the largest student organising body at UNSW, and is the main way the university hears student voices. The President of the SRC sits on governance bodies at all levels, including Academic Board and the Gendered Violence Steering Committee. The President also has the ability to delegate other SRC representatives to these meetings. As such, it&apos;s vital that representatives actually represent the students of the university.</p><p>Additionally, the faces you&apos;re seeing in student politics now are the next generation of &#x201C;real&#x201D; politicians, with several highly active student politicians going into high level positions. Getting to know them and what they stand for at this level, will provide an indication on where the future of the country is going.</p><p>I can understand why you might not care about the SRC. In my first year of university, I had absolutely no interest in student politics, and expected to continue this apathy throughout my studies. However, in the last few months of reporting on our SRC meetings, I have found a genuine interest in the proceedings of our Council, and how its members carry out their responsibilities to the student body they represent. If we want to ensure our voices are being heard and reflected in our University, then following the SRC is crucial. Hopefully, this guide will help you do so.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hung Vote: Controversial Election Motion Rejected after surprise appearance from USyd SRC President]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>The divisive proposal to move UNSW&#x2019;s SRC elections to Flexi-Week has been rejected by the closest possible margin, with 12 members of the SRC voting against it, 12 voting in favour of it, and one abstention.</p><p>Submitted to the SRC last week, it recorded the highest turnout of</p>]]></description><link>https://www.noiseatunsw.com/hung-vote-controversial-election-motion-rejected-after-surprise-appearance-from-harrison-brennan/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">668e39a635392f0001bb6a9e</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alex Neale]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 10:08:53 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://www.noiseatunsw.com/content/images/2024/07/What-happened-to-tharunka--1--1.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.noiseatunsw.com/content/images/2024/07/What-happened-to-tharunka--1--1.png" alt="Hung Vote: Controversial Election Motion Rejected after surprise appearance from USyd SRC President"><p>The divisive proposal to move UNSW&#x2019;s SRC elections to Flexi-Week has been rejected by the closest possible margin, with 12 members of the SRC voting against it, 12 voting in favour of it, and one abstention.</p><p>Submitted to the SRC last week, it recorded the highest turnout of votes of any SRC matter this year with 25; only 15-20 of the 27 officers are usually in attendance at SRC meetings.</p><p>Officers Paige Sedgwick and Cherish Kuehlmann, leading figures of the SRC&#x2019;s two major factions, read from multiple prepared statements denouncing each other&#x2019;s arguments as the extended debate progressed.</p><p>Sedgwick quickly clarified that our Flexi-Week are in fact considered academic days, and holding elections then would technically be allowed. But that did not stop her long-time rival and Education Officer Kuehlmann from labelling the proposal &#x2018;inherently discriminatory&#x2019;.</p><p>Seven speakers in favour of the motion and seven against it were allowed to state their case after SRC President Michael Rahme agreed to extend speaking time on the motion&#xA0;due to its contentiousness. Usually, only two are allowed for and two against.</p><p>While a number of councillors on all sides engaged in a heated debate, in which the council&#x2019;s integrity was questioned several times, the highlight was the surprise appearance of Sydney University SRC President Harrison Brennan, who spoke in firm opposition to the proposal.</p><p>He reinforced the arguments to the negative that a Week 6 election would unfairly favour students living close to or on campus, discriminating against voters who are underrepresented on campus, are disabled, or who live far away, adding that such a move would &#x2018;tank voter participation&#x2019;.

This is an increase of 125%. Even more egregiously, is the fact that this is just on applying for a student visa. In short, the fee is payable just for lodging the paperwork with the government, even if the application gets rejected.</p><p>The announcement was made via a <a href="https://minister.homeaffairs.gov.au/ClareONeil/Pages/fee-Increase-for-international-students-July-1.aspx?ref=noiseatunsw.com" rel="noreferrer">press release from the Department of Home Affairs</a> as part of their July 1 migration reforms designed to ease the cost-of-living, alongside funding for reform in the Higher Education sector.</p><p>Whilst there have been rumours circulating about a fee increase on Student Visas over the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/apr/08/hiking-international-student-visa-fees-is-on-the-table-but-could-it-also-pay-your-rent?ref=noiseatunsw.com"><u>past few months</u></a>, this measure was noticeably absent from the Federal Budget in May. This is despite <a href="https://www.noiseatunsw.com/federal-budget-2024/" rel="noreferrer">the budget containing a number of other measures</a> to reduce migration numbers, including capping the number of international students a university can accept, depending on several factors, including how much student accommodation they can provide.</p><p>These measures were introduced alongside a previously announced Migration Strategy, which will close loopholes around &#x201C;visa-hopping&#x201D;, whereby temporary visa holders, including students, are able to continuously extend their stay in Australia. This includes reducing the length of a Temporary Graduate Visa, and barring people on said visa from applying for a student visa whilst they remain in Australia.</p><p>Whilst the arguments behind these other measures are more nuanced, the fee hike is being widely criticised as yet another increased burden on international students, especially given the existence of these aforementioned measures.</p><p>Australia already had one of the highest student visa application costs in the world. For comparison fees in New Zealand are $375 (AU$343), and the United States are a mere $185 (AU$277). This is alongside ineligibility for student concession rates on public transport, and needing to pay large amounts upfront for courses, generally between $20-50k per year for undergraduate, temporary visa holders being unable to get HECS/HELP loans.</p><p>The fee hike is being implemented to fund recommendations made by the Universities Accord Report into long overdue reform into the higher education sector, including reducing the burden of HECS, paid practical placements, and providing FEE-free Uni Ready Courses. There is no mention however of how much extra funding this measure is expected to provide.&#xA0;</p><p>Minister for Education, Jason Clare, has stated these changes will &#x201C;strengthen integrity in the international education system&#x201D;, with Minister for Home Affairs, Clare O&#x2019;Neil adding it will &#x201C;create a migration system which is fairer, smaller, and better able to deliver for Australia&#x201D;.</p><p>However, Universities Australia chief executive, Luke Sheehy, <a href="https://universitiesaustralia.edu.au/media-item/certainty-and-growth-needed-in-international-education-2/?ref=noiseatunsw.com" rel="noreferrer">is more critical</a> of the government&#x2019;s ongoing pressure against international education, stating that Australia&#x2019;s position as a &#x201C;leading provider of international education&#x201D; is a large benefit to the nation, which can&#x2019;t go to waste.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Students for Palestine "Unilaterally" Announces the USyd Encampment has been ‘Shut Down’]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Encampment “shuts down”, to the surprise of many still active participants.

Several groups still active in the camp, including the Sydney University Muslim Students Association (SUMSA) and Students Against War (SAW), claim that the groups made a &#x201C;unilateral&#x201D; decision without meeting with other organisations involved the camp. The encampment, which started in April, aimed to pressure USyd to disclose and divest from any connections they had with companies complicit in the conflict in Gaza. Neither of these aims have been met, however, with the announcement mentioning &#x201C;empty deals&#x201D; with University Management which were turned down. The statement also announced that Students for Palestine and the SRC will be refocusing their efforts on alternative protest action, including the general meeting next semester.</p><p>Multiple groups are involved in the encampment including the<em> Sydney University Muslim Students Association</em> (SUMSA)and <em>Students Against War </em>(SAW) who say they were not consulted about the decision or announcement. SAW has also requested for their logo to be removed from SFP&#x2019;s announcement allegedly closing the camp. We spoke to Abdullah (a member of SUMSA) who reaffirmed that &#x201C;SUMSA will be continuing the encampment&#x201D; and stated that USyd has not directly ordered them to pack up.</p><p>Harrison Brennan from USyd&#x2019;s SRC acknowledged that </p><blockquote>&#x201C;the statement released by Students for Palestine in collaboration with the [USyd] SRC was admittedly unclear. To clarify, the situation is not a total decampment, but rather a strategic withdrawal from some elements of the camp.&#x201D;</blockquote><p> Harrison commented that USyd management had threatened student suspension, disciplinary hearings, and actions that&#x2019;d put international student visas at risk. Harrison also stated that those who collaborated on the statement (USyd SRC and Students Against War) were aware of its contents, particularly claiming SAW had not been present at the encampment and the statement reflected their alleged internal position.</p><p>SAW&#x2019;s official statement on Instagram does not endorse SFP&#x2019;s statement instead stating,</p><blockquote>&#xA0;&#x201C;A SAW representative who agreed to have the SAW logo included on this statement and to endorse the statement was under the impression that this statement would be about the university&#x2019;s repressive attempts to close the camp, as well as the need to organise through the holidays to mobilise a larger, more effective, student movement&#x201D;.&#xA0;</blockquote><p>It is important to frame this news with the current situation in Gaza which this encampment exists to fight for. Tragic events emerge out of Gaza with the ongoing invasion of Rafah. The Nuseirat&#xA0;Massacre of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/11/nuseirat-anatomy-of-israels-massacre-in-gaza?ref=noiseatunsw.com"><u>June 8th left 274 Palestinians dead</u></a>, with Israel claiming 4 hostages being saved in this massacre.
