<section class="gh-content gh-canvas is-body">
<p>On Wednesday night, the University of Sydney Student Representative Council voted in favour of a motion entitled <em>“HANDS OFF OUR QUEERSPACE!”</em>, which aimed to enable 24/7 access to the on-campus Queer Space, bringing their university in line with the standard at most other Sydney universities. This motion was brought forward by a member of the student-run Queer Action Collective, a political and social activist group which campaigns for queer rights, demanding 24/7 access to the space for queer students (in line with equivalent spaces at other universities), as well as unrestricted access to the space during events, the banning of police from the space, and no additional restrictions to be imposed on access in place of the existing rules.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><em>We live in a country where more than half of trans people have been sexually assaulted in their lifetimes, and the same number have experienced anti-trans hatred. Violence and abuse against the queer community does not stop during nights, events and weekends. We do not stop existing, and we do not stop needing a safe place to go.&nbsp;<br><br>For so many USYD students, the Queerspace is a small reprieve from a hostile and bigoted society. I can recall speaking with students who use the Queerspace to avoid the transphobic or homophobic abuse of their family. Staying until late so that their parents would be asleep when they got home. I have heard recounts of students at other universities who have turned to their own campus’ Queerspace after being kicked out of home for being transgender.</em><br>- Jamie Bridge, USYD SRC Queer Officer</blockquote><p>In addition to the concerns for student welfare, their demands were partially in response to the actions of the USU and the University of Sydney during Mardi Gras, where the space was taken over by private security and armed police without prior warning to queer students, in order to allow a paid event to run in the building. When questioned by the Queer Officers, Management reportedly threatened to remove them from the building. The space was seen being used for security and police operations during the event, and Queer Action Collective members were reportedly barred from re-entering the space throughout the event under threat of violence.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://www.noiseatunsw.com/content/images/2024/04/C132110B-C6B7-4567-9A9C-6882C673B059.JPG" width="576" height="1024" loading="lazy" alt></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://www.noiseatunsw.com/content/images/2024/04/D62A893D-BAAB-4EC0-9B98-DEA12997FF5C.JPG" width="576" height="1024" loading="lazy" alt></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://www.noiseatunsw.com/content/images/2024/04/EEB5F776-C856-44AD-91D0-4C9499FFB83E.JPG" width="576" height="1024" loading="lazy" alt></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://www.noiseatunsw.com/content/images/2024/04/888AF2B1-D928-4F5C-88F3-DAAF82418F8D.JPG" width="576" height="1024" loading="lazy" alt></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://www.noiseatunsw.com/content/images/2024/04/F68AA935-E668-40DD-82B0-07C9B9C6F3FF.JPG" width="576" height="1024" loading="lazy" alt></div></div></div><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Photos taken by Tim Duff on the night of the Heaps Gay afterparty at USYD, where Queer students were removed from the queer space for the event.</span></p></figcaption></figure><blockquote><em>The Queerspace represents, to many students like myself, the only space that we can safely exist, explore our own identity and shelter ourselves from the often dangerous reality of presenting queer in our heteronormative world. When I came out as non-binary in my first year of study, I felt unsafe in my home environment and used the Queerspace as a refuge to feel safe, so I could continue my studies as best as I could, until I felt safe enough to return home.<br><br>My experience isn’t one that exists in isolation, but rather a reality that affects many students. For this reason, I find it disgusting that the University removes queer students from their autonomous space after 8pm, or when Manning Bar throws a party – as it suggests to us that our rights and safety are tolerated only as long as it is profitable. Why else then, on nights including Mardi Gras, do the University management kick queer students out from their space, remove the Queerspace sign, so that private security on campus can coordinate security opportunities, while queer people are left with nowhere else to go?<br><br>I moved this motion to the Students’ Representative Council (SRC) because queer students need a space that isn’t taken from us at a moment’s notice. We deserve an autonomous space that is rightfully ours. In addition to this, I worked alongside QuAC members to cultivate student experiences with the room, and write the motion that was passed on the 3rd of April at the SRC.<br><br>The Queerspace was open 24/7 before COVID-19, and it can be open 24/7 again.</em><br>- Jo Staas, USYD Student and QuAC member</blockquote><p>The University of Sydney Queer Space is located in Manning House, which also houses Manning Bar, the university’s on-campus “live music venue”. Similar to the Roundhouse at UNSW, the building is managed by the USU, which is the University of Sydney’s Student Services and Amenities provider (think Arc@UNSW or Activate UTS). The Board includes 2 directors who are appointed by the University, and USU receives the bulk of its revenue from the “sale of goods and rendering of services” (compared to the SRC, which is entirely composed of students, and receives all of its funding from SSAF).</p><p>The idea of a 24/7 Queer Space isn’t new to the USU, and not impossible either. Prior to 2019, the space at USYD was available to queer students at all hours (other than the university’s end of year shutdown period), but this was changed while COVID measures were in place, and maintained “as a cost-cutting measure”, to the detriment of queer students.</p><blockquote><em>When management closes Queerspace and sends security officers in to remove queer students, They deny queer students not just access to a room, but access to a safe space where they can find community, safety and inclusion.<br><br>The Queerspace should be a place where queer students and queer groups like QuAC can gather for whatever they need. Whether that’s making friends, escaping a dangerous situation at home, or politically organising in hopes of making the entire world a fair, safe and accepting place for everyone.<br><br>That’s why we believe management and the USU need to stop putting profit above the needs of queer students, and open the Queerspace 24/7. We won’t move the Queerspace, and we will not accept locking it behind student ID card access.</em><br>- Jamie</blockquote><p>The USU Board was contacted for comment, but did not provide a response.</p><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">💡</div><div class="kg-callout-text">You can find out more about the campaign for a 24/7 Queerspace at <a href="http://linktr.ee/usydqueer?ref=noiseatunsw.com">http://linktr.ee/usydqueer</a>, or <a href="https://instagram.com/usydqueer?ref=noiseatunsw.com" rel="noreferrer">@usydqueer</a> on Instagram.
